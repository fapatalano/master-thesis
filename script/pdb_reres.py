"""
Renumbers the residues of the PDB file starting from a given number (default 1).

Usage:
    python pdb_reres.py -<number> <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_reres.py -10 1CTF.pdb  # renumbers from 10
    python pdb_reres.py --1 1CTF.pdb  # renumbers from -1

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
